### Description:
Let's use arrow keys to control and collect the coins. Money Maker moves on a board with the size of 10x10 fields. There is a coin on the random field of the board. When you catch a coin it will disappear from the board and appear on a different field, also random, and you get 1 point. The game ends when Mario collides with the wall.
